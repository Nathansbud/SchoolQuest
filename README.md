<h1>Unit 3 Final Project: Text Adventure 2: The Sequel</h1>
 
<strong>Interaction</strong>

Similarly to The Void, which went unfinished, Text Adventure 2 (currently unnamed) will be interacted with by way of a button interface.
Storytelling will be done almost exclusively through text, with the player deciding which path they would like to take. In addition, however,
occasional minigames will be present and will be for progression throughtout the text. Along with that (there will at the beginning) wherein 
the player must input their name, along with choose a few other options about themselves (which will serve to better allow them to connect with the story.
These will be used to slightly shape the path that things take, along with having the player called by the name that they input (among other things).
