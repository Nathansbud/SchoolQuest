<h1>Unit 3 Final Project: SchoolQuest</h1>
 
<strong>Description</strong>

SchoolQuest is a “choose your own adventure” style text-based game, allowing you to fill the role of a yet-unnamed male protagonist as he embarks on his first day of the 9th grade. Featuring multiple (though, currently, mostly unfinished) paths, you’re given the freedom to do whatever you want…provided what you want to do is one of the options provided to you. And hey, why wouldn’t it be? This project is an iteration on an earlier project of mine (also featured as a playable option that can be selected from the menu screen), named “The Void.” So strap in and get choosin’!

<strong>Interaction</strong>


Similarly to The Void, which went unfinished, SchoolQuest will be interacted with by way of a button interface.
Storytelling will be done almost exclusively through text, with the player deciding which path they would like to take. In addition, however,
occasional minigames will be present and will be for progression throughtout the text. Along with that (there will at the beginning) wherein 
the player must input their name, along with choose a few other options about themselves (which will serve to better allow them to connect with the story.
These will be used to slightly shape the path that things take, along with having the player called by the name that they input (among other things).

<strong>Getting Started</strong>

Please note, the Minim library is required to run this project. However, since the only functionality using this is the Music Player, if you can live without sweet tunes and/or are too lazy to download Minim, feel free to comment any music-related chunks out. Otherwise, a link to it can be found <a href = "https://github.com/ddf/Minim">here</a>.

Similarly to the aforementioned Void, this project is quite simple to navigate: simply run SchoolQuest, and select your desired text adventure. And…that’s about it! Navigate however you please, though be warned, a number of the paths are currently unfinished and will likely crash the game (and by crash, in this case, I simply mean quit. They won’t actually crash things, don’t worry). It should be noted that, provided Minim is present, there is an accessible music selector built -in to the text adventures, allowing you to select a song for your aural pleasure. MP3s and WAV files should work fine, though there are a few audio file types that don’t quite seem to work with Minim, so try not to set anything aflame.
