What will he do?
#
A young man sits curled in a fetal position under the covers of his bed, snoring loudly. Unfortunately for him, his alarm clock has begun to ring loudly (though he has not yet become aware of it). However, in his deep sleep, his mind is unable to come up with his name. Shocking. What will his name be?
The young man’s name is @PlayerName, yes?
# Yes
Suddenly cognizant of his name, @PlayerName groans. The jogging of his memory was all his mind needed to notify him of the incessant ringing of his nearby alarm clock, alerting him of the need to wake up. Today is, as luck would have it, this boy’s first day of the 9th grade. Yet @PlayerName, while aware of its presence, has not yet been full roused by his alarm clock. 
# Wake Up
Hopping to his feet, @PlayerName shakes his head to relieve himself of fatigue, before glancing over at the alarm clock. 7:15. Crap. His bus leaves at 7:30, and he hasn't even gotten ready yet. Sighing, @PlayerName opens his closet to get dressed. 
#Dress Comfortably
@PlayerName throws on his favorite shirt, featuring the mascot of a popular video game, along with a baggy pair of track pants and a worn pair of Crocs. He wears clothes so he doesn’t get looked at funny for not doing so, not because he’s trying to please anyone. Fashion is for the people-pleasers. 
#Dress Fashionably 
@PlayerName meticulously picks out the most fashionable options. Picking out an outfit to wear is basically an art form, but @PlayerName has it down to a goddamn science. H&M t-shirt, acceptably fashionable without trying too hard; faded red hoodie over it, to seem hip but like he doesn’t care; denim jeans, a tried and true outfit choice; a squirt of gel in the hair, just to look slick; a pair of Vans, the footwear of the popular kids. Looking stylish has never been this easy. 
#…Don’t?
Bucking the common trends of society, @PlayerName decides to make a statement. As either laziness or rebellion, @PlayerName decides to go without clothes entirely, letting it all hang out. Only God can judge him now. Or literally anybody around him. But he has no shame, and @PlayerName doesn’t care with others thing. What kind of start to the 9th grade would dressing oneself like a normal human being be? Certainly not one for the likes of @PlayerName. 
#Examine Room
@PlayerName in no real sort of hurry. The bus leaves when it leaves...if he’s on it, so be it. As such, @PlayerName stops to enjoy the view for a little bit. In the past, he was a bit of a video game lover...well, he still is, but he used to be one, too. The walls of the room are covered in posters for this and that
#Go Downstairs
Tumbling down the staircase, @PlayerName manages to maintain his long enough to reach his living room in one piece. Unfortunately, his speed at descending the staircase puts him no closer to reaching his bus on time—only five minutes are left on the clock. Every second that passes is one less second left. The bus stop is only a block away from @PlayerName’s house, but he’s yet to eat breakfast.
#Run to the Bus Stop
Skipping the most important meal of the day, you sprint out the door, bag in tow. Luckily for you, the bus doesn’t seem to have left yet, and is sitting in wait at the end of the road. Your best friend @FriendName just so happens to live in the house adjacent to your own.
